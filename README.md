# Jobb

Jobb is a program desired to automate certain things. Starting with default jobbs we implement here to provide the users with simple things like emptying a directory at a certain period of time, we are planning to implement a scripting interface for custom user jobbs.
As we plan to implement chaining different jobbs together there's a lot of stuff to do. Feel free to create a pull request or an issue if you want to.
